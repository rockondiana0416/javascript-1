<h1>Hello and Welcome!!</h1>
<p>I am using this repository to track my progress in leveling up and improving my knowledge of JavaScript. This repository's content is from a Udemy class with Brad Traversy focusing on front and backend JavaScript. I have never taken a Udemy class. I thought it would be good to try, and I like Brad Traversy's YouTube channel. </p>

<p>-Basics & Fundamentals: Data types, let & const variables, functions, conditionals, loops, object literals, arrays, etc</p>
<p>-DOM Manipulation: Selectors, traversing the DOM, show/hide, creating & removing elements, event listeners</p>
<p>-OOP: ES5 prototypes, inheritance, ES2015 classes & sub-classes, constructors</p>
<p>-Async JS: Ajax & XHR, Fetch API, callbacks, promises, async / await</p>
<p>-ES2015+: Arrow functions, template strings, generators, iterators, maps & sets, symbols & more</p>
<p>-JavaScript Patterns: Module, Factory, State, Observer, Mediator, Singleton</p>
